  Morbid: A True Crime Podcast is an American true crime anthology podcast hosted by Alaina Urquhart and Ash Kelley. Urquhart is an autopsy technician/author and Kelley is a hairdresser. Urquhart is Kelley's aunt, but the two often refer to each other as "sisters". The podcast premiered on May 1, 2018. Morbid has been included on best-of lists by Erie Reader, Vogue, The Post, and Bleeding Cool.

In 2022 Urquhart and Kelley started a podcast network called "Morbid Network" under the umbrella of the Wondery podcast network. Five podcasts exist under the production of the Morbid Network: Cult Liter with Spencer Henry, That's Spooky, Seven Deadly Sinners, Scream!, and The Strange and Unusual Podcast.

Aside from Morbid, from November 2021 to June 2022, Urquhart and Kelly also hosted a podcast in partnership with Parcast called "Crime Countdown".

Morbid: A True Crime Podcast is currently ranked in the top 20 podcasts in the United States on Spotify and Apple Podcasts as of February 20, 2023.
