        <b>Neuralink</b> is a company founded by <span id="uppercase">Elon Musk</span> in 2016 with the goal of developing brain-machine interface (BMI) technologies. The primary aim of Neuralink is to create devices that can be implanted into the human brain to enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, such as computers or other electronic devices.

        The technology being developed by Neuralink involves the use of small, flexible electrode threads that are implanted into the brain. These threads are much thinner than a human hair and are intended to be minimally invasive. The idea is to create a high-bandwidth interface between the brain and external devices, allowing for both input and output of information.

        Neuralink's potential applications include helping individuals with neurological disorders, such as paralysis or various types of brain injuries, by restoring lost functionality. Additionally, the technology could have broader implications for human-computer interaction, cognitive enhancement, and other futuristic possibilities.
